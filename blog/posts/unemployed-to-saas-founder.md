# From Unemployed to Solo SaaS Founder: The Beginning

The story of how I decided to build my own SaaS product after being laid off. This is the beginning of a journey filled with challenges, learning, and growth.

## The Decision

After 6+ years of building systems and leading teams, I found myself at a crossroads. Getting laid off was unexpected, but it gave me the freedom to pursue something I'd been thinking about for years: building my own product.

## What I'm Building

I'm working on a SaaS platform that solves a problem I've encountered repeatedly in my career. The goal is to launch an MVP within 3 months and start getting real users.

## The Challenge

Building a SaaS product as a solo founder is challenging. You're not just a developer - you're also the designer, marketer, salesperson, and support team. But that's also what makes it exciting.

## What's Next

I'm documenting this entire journey - the wins, the failures, the lessons learned. Follow along as I build my SaaS from scratch, share my technical decisions, and hopefully inspire others to take the leap.

## Key Takeaways

- Sometimes losing your job can be the push you need
- Building your own product is both scary and exciting
- Documentation and sharing helps keep you accountable
- The journey is just as important as the destination
