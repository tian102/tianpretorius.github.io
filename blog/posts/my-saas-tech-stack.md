# My SaaS Tech Stack: Why I Chose These Technologies

A deep dive into the technology choices I made for building my SaaS product, and why each one matters.

## Frontend: React + TypeScript

I chose React with TypeScript for the frontend. Type safety is crucial for catching bugs early, and React's ecosystem is mature and well-supported.

### Why React?

- Component-based architecture
- Huge ecosystem of libraries
- Great developer experience
- Strong community support
- Excellent tooling

### Why TypeScript?

- Catches bugs at compile time
- Better IDE support
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring
- Improved team collaboration

## Backend: Node.js + Express

Node.js with Express provides the flexibility I need while keeping the codebase in JavaScript/TypeScript. This allows for code sharing between frontend and backend.

### Benefits

- Same language across the stack
- Fast and lightweight
- Excellent for APIs
- Great package ecosystem
- Easy to scale horizontally

## Database: PostgreSQL + Redis

PostgreSQL for relational data because it's proven, reliable, and has excellent support for complex queries. Redis for caching and session management to keep things fast.

### PostgreSQL Advantages

- ACID compliance
- Powerful query capabilities
- JSON support
- Excellent performance
- Rock-solid reliability

### Redis Use Cases

- Session storage
- Cache layer
- Real-time features
- Message queues
- Rate limiting

## Deployment: AWS + Docker

Containerization with Docker makes deployments consistent and reliable. AWS provides all the infrastructure I need with great scaling capabilities.

### AWS Services Used

- EC2 for compute
- RDS for PostgreSQL
- ElastiCache for Redis
- S3 for file storage
- CloudFront for CDN
- Route 53 for DNS

### Docker Benefits

- Consistent environments
- Easy local development
- Simplified deployments
- Portable across providers
- Better resource utilization

## Development Tools

### Version Control

- Git + GitHub
- Feature branch workflow
- Pull request reviews
- CI/CD integration

### CI/CD

- GitHub Actions
- Automated testing
- Automatic deployments
- Environment management

### Monitoring

- Application logs
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- User analytics
- Uptime monitoring

## Why These Choices?

I chose technologies I know well and that have strong communities. When you're a solo founder, you don't have time to learn everything from scratch. Pick what you know and what works.

### Key Principles

- Use proven technology
- Leverage your existing knowledge
- Choose tools with good communities
- Don't over-engineer
- Prioritize developer experience

## What I'd Do Differently

Looking back, there are a few things I might change:

- Consider serverless for some services
- Use managed databases from the start
- Invest more in monitoring early on
- Set up better local development environment

## Conclusion

Your tech stack should enable you to move fast and build reliably. Choose what you know, but be willing to adapt as you grow.
