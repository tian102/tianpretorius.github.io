## The Decision

After 6+ years climbing the corporate ladder to CTO, I made one of the scariest decisions of my life: I left my stable position to build my own SaaS product. No safety net, no co-founder, just me and an idea that wouldn't stop nagging me.

### Why Now?

The question everyone asks: "Why would you leave a CTO position?" Here's my brutally honest answer:

- **I wanted to build something of my own** - Years of building for others left me hungry to create something that was truly mine
- **I hit a ceiling** - Despite the title and raises, I felt like I was trading time for money without building real equity
- **The itch was unbearable** - I couldn't stop thinking about product ideas and what could be possible if I just went for it

## What I'm Building

Without giving away too much (stealth mode for now), I'm focusing on a B2B SaaS in the automation space. It combines my engineering background with a real problem I encountered countless times in my corporate roles.

Think: making complex workflows simple for non-technical teams.

### The Plan (Version 1.0)

1. **Months 1-2**: MVP development ← *we are here*
2. **Month 3**: First 10 beta users
3. **Months 4-6**: Iterate based on feedback
4. **Month 6**: Public launch
5. **Month 12**: Profitable or pivot

Spoiler: This plan will probably change. But having a plan beats wandering aimlessly.

## Day 1 Realizations

On my first official day as a "founder," here's what hit me:

### Freedom is Terrifying

No one is telling me what to do. No meetings. No status reports. Just me, my laptop, and an empty calendar. 

It's both exhilarating and paralyzing.

### Imposter Syndrome is Real

Who am I to think I can build a successful company? I've managed teams, but can I actually ship a product people will pay for? 

The inner critic is LOUD.

### The Hours are Longer (But Different)

I'm working more hours than when I had a salary. But they're *my* hours, on *my* terms, for *my* future. That makes all the difference.

## What's Next

Tomorrow, I start coding. The plan is to:
- Set up the development environment
- Build the core authentication flow
- Create the basic dashboard structure
- Ship something by end of week

I'll be documenting the journey here—the wins, the failures, the late-night debugging sessions, and everything in between.

## Why Share This Journey?

Three reasons:

1. **Accountability** - Public commitment is powerful
2. **Learning** - Teaching forces you to understand deeper
3. **Community** - Maybe my mistakes can save you some pain

If you're thinking about making a similar leap, follow along. Let's learn together.

**What I learned today**: The hardest part isn't quitting your job—it's trusting yourself enough to try.

**Tomorrow's goal**: Ship the authentication system.
