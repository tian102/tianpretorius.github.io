## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (That Will Fix Themselves)

### 404 Errors for Markdown Files
**What you're seeing:**
```
GET /blog/posts/2025-03-15-day-1-solo-founder.md 404 (Not Found)
GET /projects/data/opencv-vitamin-recognition.md 404 (Not Found)
```

**Why this happens:**
The markdown files exist in your local repository and are committed, but GitHub Pages hasn't rebuilt your site yet. The deployed version is still the old site without these files.

**How to fix:**
1. Commit all your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete website transformation"
   ```

2. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Wait 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild

4. Clear your browser cache and refresh

### Service Worker 404
**Error:** `SW registration failed: script sw.js not found`

**Fix:** The service worker file exists (`sw.js` in root). This will resolve after deployment.

### Icon Path Issue
**Error:** `icon-192.png not found`

**Fix:** Check that `assets/icon-192.png` exists. If not, you can:
- Remove the apple-touch-icon line from HTML, or
- Add a 192x192px PNG icon to `/assets/`

## üöÄ Testing Locally

To test before pushing:

1. **Use a local server** (GitHub Pages paths work differently than file://):
   ```bash
   # Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Node.js
   npx serve
   
   # PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Visit:** http://localhost:8000

3. **You should see:**
   - Landing page with hero section
   - Featured projects section (may be empty if files 404)
