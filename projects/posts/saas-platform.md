# SaaS Platform

A full-stack SaaS application designed to handle multi-tenant architecture with robust user management and subscription billing.

## Key Features

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Secure data isolation per organization
- **Subscription Billing**: Integrated with Stripe for recurring payments
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and insights
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permissions management
- **REST API**: Well-documented API for third-party integrations

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS, Redis
- **Payment**: Stripe Integration
- **Auth**: JWT with refresh tokens

## Challenges Overcome

One of the biggest challenges was implementing efficient multi-tenancy while maintaining data security and query performance. I solved this using a hybrid approach with schema-per-tenant for larger clients and shared schema with row-level security for smaller accounts.

## Results

- Handles 10,000+ active users
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Sub-200ms API response times
- Successfully processing $100K+ MRR
