# Microservices API Gateway

A custom-built API gateway in Go designed to handle high-throughput traffic with intelligent routing, caching, and security features.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Routing**: Dynamic service discovery and load balancing
- **Authentication**: JWT validation with token refresh
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-endpoint rate limits
- **Request/Response Caching**: Redis-based caching layer
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic failover and retry logic
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and distributed tracing

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Service Mesh**: Kubernetes with Istio
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus & Grafana
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Go?

Chose Go for its exceptional performance, built-in concurrency, and low memory footprint. The gateway handles 50,000+ requests per second on modest hardware.

### Rate Limiting Strategy

Implemented a distributed rate limiter using Redis and the token bucket algorithm, ensuring fair resource allocation across all microservices.

## Performance Metrics

- **Throughput**: 50,000+ RPS
- **Latency**: p99 < 10ms
- **Uptime**: 99.99%
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB under load

## Security Features

- TLS termination
- SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration
- Request validation and sanitization
- IP whitelisting/blacklisting

The gateway serves as the single entry point for all external API requests, providing a secure and performant interface to our microservices ecosystem.
