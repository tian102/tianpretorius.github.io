# Building This Portfolio - A Labor of Love and Necessity

![Cover Image](./cover.jpg)

I'll be honest—this portfolio came out of necessity. But it also came from something deeper: the need to build, to create, to feel productive when everything else felt uncertain.

The past few months have been... well, let's just say they haven't been what I expected. After being unemployed for longer than I'd care to admit, I found myself in a strange limbo. No job offers coming through, no daily routine, no sense of forward momentum. It's easy to feel a bit dejected when you're in that space.

But here's what I've learned: when you're a builder at heart, you don't stop building just because the circumstances aren't ideal.

## Why I Built This

At first, it was purely practical. I needed a portfolio. A place to showcase my work, share my thoughts, and hopefully catch the attention of someone who might want to hire me. The standard [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tian-pretorius-817a2189/ "LinkedIn - Tian Pretorius") profile and [Resume](/assets/Tian-Pretorius-CV.pdf "CV - Tian Pretorius") just weren't cutting it—I needed something more, something that showed not just what I'd done, but who I am as an engineer.

But as I started working on it, something shifted. The act of building this site became more than just a job-hunting tool. It became a lifeline.

When you're unemployed, it's easy to lose your sense of purpose. Days blend together. You start questioning your skills, your worth, your place in this industry. But when you're creating something—even something as simple as a personal website—you remember why you got into this field in the first place.

**Building gives me purpose.** And right now, that's not abundant.

## The Constraint That Shaped Everything

Here's the thing about being unemployed: you don't have money for fancy hosting services. No AWS credits, no Vercel Pro, no fancy CDN. Every dollar counts.

So I went looking for free hosting options, and that's when I found [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages "GitHub Pages documentation").

It was perfect—free, reliable, and git-based (which I already knew). But it came with its own quirks. [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages "GitHub Pages documentation") is designed for static sites, and while that's great for performance, it meant I had to think differently about how I structured everything.

No backend. No database. Just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some markdown files.

And you know what? That constraint was liberating.

Instead of reaching for a framework or a CMS, I had to think about what I actually needed. Not what was trendy or what everyone else was using, but what would solve my specific problem with the resources I had.

## The Ups and Downs

Was it smooth sailing? Not exactly.

[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages "GitHub Pages documentation") has its quirks—deployment can be finicky, there are some limitations on how you can structure things, and the documentation assumes you know more than you might. I hit walls. I got frustrated. There were definitely moments where I wanted to just pay for hosting somewhere else and be done with it.

But I'm stubborn. Maybe too stubborn.

There's a longer story about my stubbornness and some questionable decisions (like reinventing wheels that didn't need reinventing), but I'll save that for the [project](projects.html?project=portfolio-website "Portfolio Website with Markdown Content System") breakdown. Let's just say I learned a lot about what *not* to do, even if I did it anyway.

## What I Hope This Brings

I've poured time and effort into this site—probably more than was strictly necessary. Late nights tweaking animations, restructuring content, refining the build system. All while wondering if anyone would even see it.

But I hope it pays off.

Personally, I hope it reminds me that I'm still capable. That even when things aren't going the way I planned, I can still create something I'm proud of. That my skills still have value, even if the job market hasn't validated that yet.

Professionally, I hope this shows potential employers (or clients, or collaborators) what I can do. Not just the technical skills—though those are here—but the drive, the problem-solving, the ability to ship something under constraints.

The return on investment might not be immediate. It might not even be measurable. But I have to believe that putting this work out there, being visible, sharing both the wins and the struggles—that all of this matters.

## Why I Still Love This

Despite the uncertainty, despite the frustration of job hunting, despite the self-doubt that creeps in at 2 AM—I still love building things.

This portfolio reminded me of that.

There's something satisfying about taking an idea and making it real. About solving problems, big and small. About seeing your vision come to life in a browser window.

That feeling is what keeps me going. It's what made me choose this career in the first place, and it's what I hope will carry me through to whatever comes next.

## What's Next

I don't know where this portfolio will take me. Maybe it'll land me a job. Maybe it'll lead to freelance work. Maybe it'll just be a nice thing I built that no one ever sees except me.

But I built it. And right now, in this moment, that's enough.

If you're reading this and you're in a similar place—unemployed, uncertain, maybe a little dejected—I hope this encourages you. Build something. It doesn't have to be perfect. It doesn't even have to be useful. Just build.

Because the act of creating, of making something from nothing, is its own reward. And sometimes, when things feel out of control, that's exactly what you need.
